**SmartMirror** is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the **SmartMirror** allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. **SmartMirror** is built by the creator of [the original MagicMirror](https://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror).

SmartMirror focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!
