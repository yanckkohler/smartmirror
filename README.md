**SmartMirror** is a modular open source platform for smart mirrors. **SmartMirror** allows you to turn your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant.

SmartMirror relies on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. This means that no further web server or browser installations are necessary!
